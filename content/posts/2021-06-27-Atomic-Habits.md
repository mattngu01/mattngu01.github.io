# Habits shaping your identity
- many people change habits focusing on _what_ they want to change
- the author suggests that we should do habits that focus on _who_ we wish to become
    - you're more likely to take actions that validate or align with your identity
    - "I want to become someone who is an athlete" vs. "I want to get skinny"

# The four step model for human behavior & habits
1. Cue -> information that predicts an award
    - first indication we're close to an award; information that predicts an award
    - cues are meaningless until they are interpreted
    - ex: sound of slot machines can trigger a gambler, but for anyone else it's just a bell
2. Craving
    - motivational force behind every habit, without craving a change nothing happens
    - "you don't crave smoking a cigarette, you crave the feeling of relief it provides"
3. Response -> the actual habit; takes form of thought or action
    - depends on how motivated you are and how much friction with the behavior
    - too much effort? won't do it, you also have to be capable of doing it
4. Reward
    - satisfy your craving; eating & food gives you energy, but immediately it gives you relief from thirst or hunger
    - teaches us which actions are worth remembering

Disrupting any of these steps can stop a habit, or promoting these steps can keep a habit going.

## Example of the four step model
1. Cue -> You wake up in the morning and you're tired
2. Craving -> You want to feel awake and alert
3. Response -> You drink coffee
4. Reward -> You satisfy your craving to feel awake. Drinking coffee becomes associated with waking up.

# Manipulating the 4 steps to make or break a habit
1. Cue -> make it obvious/invisible
2. Craving -> make it attractive/unattractive
3. Response -> make it easy/difficult
4. reward -> make it satisfying/unsatisfying

# 1st law (Cues): Making it obvious/invisible
- many of the cues that we process, we do it subconsciously
- bringing these cues to the **conscious** level is a way we can start break habits
    - **Pointing-and-Calling** -> originating from Japanese railway systems, you point to important indicators (or cues) and verbally call out their status
        - ex: in a train pulling into a station, point at the speedometer and call out the speed of the train
        - reduced errors up to 85% and cut accidents by 30%
- whenever you notice yourself doing a habit, ask yourself, "Does this behavior help me become the type of person I wish to be?"

## Starting a new habit
- implementation intentions = "When situation X arises, I will perform response Y"
    - this is an effective way for helping us stick to goals, check book for those studies
- making a specific plan helps you follow through
    - ex: I'm going to eat healthier by cooking food at home twice a week
    - "I will [ BEHAVIOR ] at [ TIME ] in [ LOCATION ]"
- two of the most common cues are time and location
    - we always get hungry around lunchtime, or we start craving coffee once we get to work 
- when we make things vague, we leave it up to a random spark of motivation to help us start our new habit, or we end up pursuing rabbit holes that are unrelated to the habit we want to start
- when we want to keep a habit, it is desired that interpreting these cues becomes **subconscious**
- habit stacking -> attaching another habit to a pre-existing habit
    - ex: After I take off my shoes coming home from work, I will immediately change into my workout clothes.
    - this is how routines are made; you don't need to think about what you need to do next
    - make the previous cue specific! being vague about when you'll do something will cause you think about what to do

## Environment > Motivation
- behavior is a function of the person in their environment
    - ex: customers will buy more products that are at eye level than those near the floor
- by making the cues for our habits easily perceptible, then we're more likely to act on the cue
- vice versa, if we hide the cue, we won't be as inclined to do our habit
- most persistent behaviors have multiple cues
- over time habits become associated with the context for behavior rather than a single trigger
- behavior defined by relationship to objects in our environment
    - ex: the couch is where you read vs. the couch is where you watch TV and eat ice cream
- try associating new habit with new context instead of have it compete with cues for other habits; try not to mix contexts for habits
    - always good to have one space for each context (one room for working, one for relaxing, etc)
- our habits rarely actually go away, the environment just changes so that we are not triggered to do our habit
    - essentially, we are the product of our environment

# 2nd law (Craving): Make it attractive/unattractive
- supernormal stimuli -> stimulus that elicits a response strongly than the stimulus for which it evolved
    - ex: junk food for humans; too much sugar in our food
- we tend to like experiences that are varied and not just the same every time
- dopamine plays a large part in our habits, it often serves as the base motivation
    - the anticipation of the reward has a large dopamine spike and serves as the reason for taking action
- temptation bundling -> linking an action you _want_ to do with an action you _need_ to do
    - ex: ABC channel promoting drinking & relaxing with their shows
    - Premack's Principle -> highly preferred activities effective as reinforcers for less preferable activities

## Social norms & habits
- we imitate the habits of those close to you, the many, and the powerful
- effective way to build habits is join culture where desired behavior is normal behavior; also find something in common with the group to make it easier to integrate
    - your culture sets expectation for what is normal
- we find powerful people's habits attractive because we believe it will get us approval, respect, etc
    - on the flip side, we avoid behaviors that would lower our status

## Find and fix causes of bad habits
- today's habits are modern day solutions for ancient desires
    - ex: browsing on facebook -> connect & bond with others
- you can find alternative habits for the desires underlying bad habits
- "enjoying hard habits" -> change mindset of habits from being burdens to opportunities
    - " I need to go run in the morning" -> "It's time to build endurance and get fast"
- motivation ritual -> associate habits with something you enjoy
    - ex: athlete pregame ritual

# 3rd law (Response): Make it easy/difficult
- planning your habits or finding the best way to enact your habit often leads nowhere
    - planning the best workouts does not get you in shape, starting to work out does
    - doing this planning or researching makes you feel like you're making progress, but you're really not
- habits form on frequency, not time - the rate matters more than the time span
    - focus on repetition before researching how to do the habit in the best way

## The law of least effort
- nature always follows the path of least effort
- the more effort habit a requires, the less likely we'll stick to it
    - scrolling on our phones, checking emails, watching television are all low effort 
- it is important to make habits easy so that when we run out of motivation, then we can still do it easily and won't skip out
- it's like trying to get water flowing in a hose, you can either remove the kink in the hose or increase water pressure to force the water out
- ways to reduce friction associated with habits:
    - environmental design to make actions easier
    - simplify habits to decrease mental load & friction
- set up your environment ahead of time to prepare for your habit
    - ex: keep pencil, pens & notebooks within reach if you want to draw more often
    - ex: unplug tv after you finish watching to increase friction

## Two minute rule
- easier to continue what you are already doing than to start doing something different
- the beginning of the habit is often the most influential moment (these are **decisive moments**); you're more likely to go for a run outside if you already put on workout clothes
- decisive moments set the available actions you can do
    - ex: walking into a restaurant decides what you'll be eating for lunch, but you can still pick anything from the menu
- habits are the entry point for the behavior
- "when you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do"
    - the first two minutes should be easy to do, then you can slowly ramp up the difficulty
- the point in this is to **master the habit of showing up**
- habit shaping -> process of scaling habit towards the end goal
    - change into workout clothes -> step outside the door -> drive to gym, exercise for 5 minutes -> exercise for 15 minutes once per week -> exercise 3 times a week

## Commitment Devices
- choice you make in the present that controls actions in the future
- ex: reduce overeating by purchasing individual packages instead of in bulk
- make good habits require more work to get out off rather than getting started on it
- make bad habits impractical to do; like getting rid of all cigarettes & lighters when you're trying to quit smoking

# 4th law (Reward): Make it satisfying/unsatisfying

## Immediate and Delayed Rewards
- time inconsistency -> the way our brain evaluates rewards is inconsistent; we tend to prioritize short term rewards over long term
- usually in bad habits the rewards are immediate while the consequences are long term
- delaying gratification is the key to many successes
- we can promote habits that give long term benefits by adding immediate pleasure to associate with the habit
    - use rewards that align with your identity

## Maintaining your habits
- habit tracker -> use your calendar and mark off days that you do the habit
- don't break the chain of doing the habit
- if you do miss it, never miss twice
- Goodhart's Law -> "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure"
    - when we have targets, we end up optimizing to hit the target instead of having quality work
    - point of measurement is to add context to larger picture and as a guide

## Accountability Partners

There's a section on this in the book, but I think it's pretty self-explanatory.

# Miscellaneous Advice

## Talent & Genes
- genetics do play a large part in a lot of things, but you can choose the activities where your genes give an advantage
    - the genetic strength in one area can also be the weakness in another
- build habits that complement your personality
     - don't feel obligated to follow the habits that everyone else does, choose the ones that are best for you
     - habits need to be enjoyable for you to stick to it
- finding habits where the odds are in your favor is mostly just trial and error
    - What feels fun to me but work to others?
    - What makes me lose track of time?
    - Where do I get greater returns than the average person? 
    - What comes naturally to me?

## Goldilocks Rule
- try to keep the habit in the middle of the spectrum between boredom and failure (easy and hard)
- greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom -> we often get good enough to get bored and the outcome becomes expected 
    - try to create some kind of novelty (variable reward)
- "Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way"

## Deliberate Practice and Habits
- with habits, we can overlook small errors in what we do
- mastering one habit is supposed to unlock a higher level of activity or habit
- Reflection and reviewing your habits is the key to improving long term
- author's reviews: 
    - annual review
        - What went well this year?
        - What didn't go so well this year?
        - What did I learn?
    - semi-annual review
        - What are the core values that drive my life and work?
        - How am I living and working with integrity right now?
        - How can I set a higher standard in the future?
- your identity and beliefs can hold you back from changing
    - do not make a single aspect of your identity the majority
    - losing this central identity trait can cause confusion and sense of being lost
